## About Me
I am a student who is particularly excited about innovating with new technology - I love to explore how emerging technologies can be used to solve current problems.

I enjoy learning, experimenting and creating something new, focusing on clarity and communication in my collaborative work.

Outside of academics, I do:
- Technical Projects and Competitions (E.g. PA Raspberry Pi Competition, other personal projects).
- AI Soc, D&D, Badminton.

## Projects
### [HydroHeat](https://github.com/JJTB100/HydroHeat)
Taking heat from servers and using it to heat houses - our winning entry into the PA Consulting Raspberry Pi competition.

Large data centres lose Â£1.5m of energy costs to wasted heat, our Team HydroHeat created a prototype device that takes server heat and stores it in a liquid. Recycling this energy allows the heating of buildings or swimming pools.

(also see [RiverSafe](https://github.com/JJTB100/RiverSafe), my previous finalist entry)

### [A-Level NEA](https://github.com/JJTB100/A-Level-NEA)
An app that trains piano chords by listening to the user play.

An Object-Oriented combination of FFT, Sound Processing and Music Theory.

### [Neural Network From Scratch](https://github.com/JJTB100/NeuralNetworkFromScratch)
A python project with the goal of creating a neural network to recognise handwritten numbers - no Torch or similar.

Uses the MNist dataset for training.

### [AdventOfCode](https://github.com/JJTB100/AdventOfCode)
My Solutions to the Advent of Code Puzzles
